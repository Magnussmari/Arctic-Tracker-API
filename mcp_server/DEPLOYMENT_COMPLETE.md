## 🔨 How to Use

### Claude Desktop
1. **Restart Claude Desktop** to load the new configuration
2. **Start a new conversation**
3. **Look for the MCP hammer icon** 🔨 in the interface
4. **Ask natural language questions** about your Arctic species data

### Claude Code  
1. **Open terminal** in your Arctic Tracker project directory
2. **Run**: `claude`
3. **The arctic-tracker MCP server** will be automatically available
4. **Use it for coding tasks** related to your Arctic research

## 🧊 Example Queries to Try

### Basic Species Queries
```
"List all Arctic marine mammals in the database"
"Search for polar bears in the species database"  
"Show me all species in the family BALAENOPTERIDAE"
"Find species with 'seal' in their common name"
```

### CITES Trade Analysis
```
"Get CITES trade data for polar bears from 2020-2023"
"Show me all trade records from Canada as exporter"
"What species have the most CITES trade activity?"
"Find trade records with purpose code 'T' (commercial)"
```

### Conservation Status
```
"What's the IUCN conservation status of narwhals?"
"Show me all CITES Appendix I species in the database"
"List endangered Arctic species"
"Get conservation assessments for marine mammals"
```

### Research Workflows
```
"Compare threat levels between Arctic marine and terrestrial mammals"
"Show me species distribution data for the Canadian Arctic"
"What are the main threats to Arctic fox populations?"
"Find species missing IUCN assessments in our database"
```

### Database Analysis
```
"How many species do we have in each taxonomic class?"
"Show me the families table structure"
"Get trade summary data for the last 5 years"
"List all tables in the Arctic Tracker database"
```

## 🛠 Available Tools

Your AI assistant now has access to these specialized tools:

1. **`list_arctic_species`** - Filter by taxonomic groups, conservation status, region
2. **`search_species`** - Search by scientific/common names or family
3. **`get_cites_trade_data`** - Comprehensive CITES trade record queries
4. **`get_conservation_status`** - IUCN Red List and CITES listing information
5. **`get_species_threats`** - Threat assessment data
6. **`get_distribution_data`** - Arctic region distribution information
7. **`get_trade_summary`** - Pre-aggregated trade analysis
8. **`query_database`** - Generic tool for any table queries

## 🔍 What Makes This Special

This isn't just a generic database connector - it's specifically designed for Arctic research:

- **Understands CITES trade patterns** and terminology
- **Knows Arctic regions** (Canadian Arctic, Greenland, Svalbard, etc.)
- **Integrates conservation data** from multiple sources (IUCN, CITES)
- **Handles taxonomic relationships** including your normalized family data
- **Supports research workflows** common in conservation science

## 🧪 Test It Right Now!

1. **Open Claude Desktop** (restart it first if it was running)
2. **Start a new conversation** 
3. **Try this query**: 
   > "Use the Arctic Tracker database to list all Arctic marine mammals. Show me their scientific names, common names, and conservation status."

4. **Look for the MCP hammer icon** 🔨 - this confirms the connection is working

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work:

1. **Check the MCP icon**: Should see 🔨 in Claude Desktop
2. **Restart Claude Desktop**: Configuration changes require restart
3. **Run verification**: `./verify-deployment.sh` in the mcp_server directory
4. **Check logs**: Look for error messages in the Claude interface

## 🎓 Advanced Usage

### For Complex Research Queries
```
"Analyze trade patterns for Arctic marine mammals over the last decade. 
Show me which countries are the main exporters and importers, 
and identify any concerning trends."
```

### For Data Validation
```
"Check our database for data quality issues. Are there any species 
missing IUCN assessments? Any trade records with unusual patterns?"
```

### For Research Planning
```
"Based on our current data, what Arctic species would benefit from 
additional conservation research? Consider their trade volume, 
threat levels, and data gaps."
```

## 🌟 Next Level Research

Your Arctic Tracker database is now connected to AI reasoning capabilities. This means you can:
