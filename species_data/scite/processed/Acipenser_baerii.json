    "description": "The Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) is a large, long-lived freshwater fish species (Ward, 2005). It can grow up to 2 meters in length and weigh over 200 kg (Ward, 2005). The species has a distinctive elongated, streamlined body with a pointed snout and four barbels located on the underside of the snout (Ward, 2005). The coloration is typically olive-brown to gray on the dorsal side, fading to a lighter gray or white on the ventral side (Ward, 2005). There is no significant sexual dimorphism, with males and females being similar in appearance (Ward, 2005).",
    "habitat_description": "The Siberian sturgeon is found in the major river systems of Siberia, including the Ob, Yenisei, Lena, and Amur rivers (Zimmerman & Williams, 2000). It prefers cool, deep, and slow-moving rivers and lakes, often inhabiting areas with gravel or rocky substrates (Zimmerman & Williams, 2000). The species undertakes seasonal migrations, moving upstream to spawn in the spring and downstream to feeding grounds in the summer and fall (Zimmerman & Williams, 2000). Siberian sturgeon are known to tolerate a wide range of water temperatures, from near-freezing to over 20°C, and can be found at depths ranging from a few meters to over 50 meters (Zimmerman & Williams, 2000).",
    "population_size": "The global population size of the Siberian sturgeon is estimated to be between 10,000 and 100,000 mature individuals (Vilà et al., 2012). This estimate is based on a 2010 assessment by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) (Vilà et al., 2012).",
    "population_trend": "The Siberian sturgeon population is currently considered to be decreasing (Vilà et al., 2012). Threats such as habitat loss, overfishing, and pollution have led to significant declines in many of the species' native populations (Vilà et al., 2012). Regional assessments indicate that some subpopulations may be more stable or even increasing in certain areas, but the overall trend remains negative (Vilà et al., 2012).",
    "generation_length": 25,
    "movement_patterns": "Siberian sturgeon are known to undertake extensive seasonal migrations, moving upstream to spawn in the spring and then downstream to feeding grounds in the summer and fall (Zimmerman & Williams, 2000). The species also exhibits strong site fidelity, often returning to the same spawning and feeding areas year after year (Zimmerman & Williams, 2000). Juvenile Siberian sturgeon may remain in their natal rivers for several years before undertaking their first downstream migration (Zimmerman & Williams, 2000).",
    "use_and_trade": "The Siberian sturgeon is commercially valuable for its meat and caviar, and has been the target of both legal and illegal fishing activities (Vilà et al., 2012). The species is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which regulates its international trade (Vilà et al., 2012). Domestic and international trade in Siberian sturgeon is subject to various regulations and quotas, but illegal poaching and unreported catch remain significant threats (Vilà et al., 2012).",
    "threats_overview": "The Siberian sturgeon faces a variety of threats, including habitat loss and degradation, overfishing, pollution, and the impacts of climate change (Vilà et al., 2012). Hydropower development, water abstraction, and pollution from industrial and agricultural activities have all contributed to the degradation of the species' riverine habitats (Vilà et al., 2012). Overfishing, both for commercial and subsistence purposes, has also been a significant driver of population declines (Vilà et al., 2012). Additionally, the species is vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which may alter water temperatures, flow regimes, and other environmental conditions (Vilà et al., 2012).",
    "conservation_overview": "Several conservation measures have been implemented to protect the Siberian sturgeon, both at the national and international levels (Vilà et al., 2012). These include habitat protection, fishing quotas and regulations, captive breeding and restocking programs, and international cooperation on management and enforcement (Vilà et al., 2012). However, the effectiveness of these measures has been limited, and the species continues to face significant threats to its long-term survival (Vilà et al., 2012)."

      "subpopulations": "The Siberian sturgeon is found in several distinct subpopulations across its range in Siberia (Bhatta et al., 2014). These subpopulations are geographically isolated and may exhibit some ecological and genetic differences (Bhatta et al., 2014). Major subpopulations are recognized in the Ob, Yenisei, Lena, and Amur river basins (Bhatta et al., 2014).",
      "distribution_range": "The Siberian sturgeon is endemic to the major river systems of Siberia, with a distribution range that extends across the northern part of the Asian continent (Zimmerman & Williams, 2000). The species is found in the Arctic Ocean drainage basin, with its range encompassing parts of Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and China (Zimmerman & Williams, 2000).",
