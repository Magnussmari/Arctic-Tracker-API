    "description": "Balaena mysticetus, commonly known as the Bowhead whale, is a large baleen whale characterized by its robust body, which can reach lengths of up to 18–20 meters and weigh approximately 75–100 tons (George et al., 2016). Its coloration ranges from dark gray to black, often with white patches on the chin and lower jaw (Zhu et al., 2001). The species exhibits sexual dimorphism; males tend to be slightly smaller than females, which can mature at lengths of about 18 meters (Rehorek et al., 2018). A unique feature of the bowhead whale is its baleen plates, which can measure up to 3.5 meters long, aiding in filter-feeding on zooplankton (Ball et al., 2015).",
    "habitat_description": "Bowhead whales inhabit the Arctic and subarctic regions, predominantly in areas with seasonal sea ice. They prefer shallow continental shelf habitats, typically found at depths of less than 300 meters Nielsen et al., 2015). Seasonal movements correlate with sea ice patterns, as they follow the retreating ice edge in spring toward summer feeding grounds in the Beaufort Sea and return to wintering grounds in the Bering Sea (Olnes et al., 2020; .",
    "population_size": "The most recent population estimates indicate that the Western Arctic stock (Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas) has increased to approximately 18,000 individuals as of 2023 (Hansen et al., 2023). Moreover, the Spitsbergen stock is currently regarded as critically endangered, with estimates placing their numbers around 102 individuals Boertmann et al., 2015).",
    "population_trend": "The population of the bowhead whale appears to be increasing, particularly in the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock, which has shown significant recovery since the cessation of commercial whaling. However, the Spitsbergen stock remains critically low and continues to be monitored for recovery (Hansen et al., 2023), Boertmann et al., 2015). Regular assessments indicate a stable trend for the Western stock, with an increasing observational rate of calves (Tervo et al., 2023; .",
    "generation_length": 35,
    "movement_patterns": "Bowhead whales exhibit strong migratory patterns, transiting from wintering areas in the Bering Sea to summer feeding grounds in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. In the spring, they migrate through leads in the ice cover, and they often demonstrate site fidelity, returning to the same breeding and feeding areas annually (Olnes et al., 2020; , Harwood et al., 2017).",
    "use_and_trade": "Bowhead whales have been historically hunted, but current usage is limited to regulated subsistence hunting by Indigenous populations in Alaska and Greenland. This practice is subject to quotas set by the International Whaling Commission (IWC), recognizing their endangered status under CITES Zeh et al., 2002).",
    "threats_overview": "Major threats to bowhead whales include climate change, which affects their ice-dependent habitat, as well as hunting pressures, particularly subsistence hunting in certain regions (Moore & Huntington, 2008; . Additional risks involve pollution, industrial activities, and vessel strikes, which pose significant risks to their populations Blackwell et al., 2021). Enhanced shipping routes due to ice melt also increase potential mortality risks from vessel collisions (Moore & Huntington, 2008; , Blackwell et al., 2021).",
    "conservation_overview": "Various conservation actions are in place for bowhead whales, including international agreements aimed at protecting their populations. These actions involve oversight by the IWC, habitat protection initiatives, and recognized subsistence quotas to sustain traditional hunting practices (Hansen et al., 2023), Zeh et al., 2002). Additionally, monitoring programs focus on observed population trends and habitat use (Hansen et al., 2023)."

      "subpopulations": "There are four recognized management stocks of bowhead whales: the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas (BCB) stock, the East Canada-West Greenland stock (ECWG), the Okhotsk Sea stock (OKH), and the East Greenland-Svalbard-Barents Sea stock (EGSB) (Baird et al., 2023).",
      "distribution_range": "The bowhead whale is primarily distributed in the Arctic region, extending from the Bering Sea to the western Atlantic, including the Beaufort Sea, East Greenland, and parts of the Barents Sea. This species is considered circumpolar, with population concentrations varying between the Atlantic and Pacific sectors (Tervo et al., 2023; , Nielsen et al., 2015).",
