    "description": "The narwhal (Monodon monoceros) is a medium-sized toothed whale found primarily in Arctic and sub-Arctic waters. Adult narwhals typically measure between 4.5 and 5.5 meters in length, with males tending to be larger, reaching weights of up to 1,600 kg, while females average around 900 kg (Higdon, 2009). One of the notable physical features of this species is the long, spiraled tusk, which is actually an elongated tooth; males possess this tusk, which can grow up to 3 meters in length, while females generally do not have tusks or have much shorter ones (Higdon, 2009)(Shuert et al., 2023). The coloration of narwhals varies seasonally; during summer they display mottled gray and blue patterns, becoming more uniform gray or brownish in winter (Charry et al., 2018; . The presence of the tusk is a distinguishing characteristic of male narwhals (Shuert et al., 2023).",
    "habitat_description": "Narwhals are predominantly found in the colder waters of the Arctic, especially around Greenland, Canada, and the Russian Arctic (Higdon, 2009). Their preferred habitats are sea ice-covered areas as they rely on ice for their hunting grounds, specifically in fjords and deep-water canyons (Higdon, 2009). Narwhals conduct seasonal migrations influenced by ice coverage; they move toward the sea ice in summer for feeding and retreat to the open waters or ice floes in autumn and winter (Higdon, 2009)(Shuert et al., 2023). Typically, they dive to depths of 1,500 meters but can dive deeper when foraging, primarily targeting fish, squid, and crustaceans (Shuert et al., 2023).",
    "population_size": "As of a 2019 survey, the estimated global population of narwhals is around 80,000 individuals, primarily based on aerial surveys and marine mammal monitoring in regions such as Baffin Bay and Greenland (Charry et al., 2018; . This figure is subject to updates as ongoing research provides new insights into population dynamics.",
    "population_trend": "The overall trend for narwhal populations is considered stable in certain regions, such as the Baffin Bay population, although some populations face declines due to environmental changes and human impacts (Charry et al., 2018; . Continuous monitoring is essential as regional assessments indicate fluctuations influenced by climate conditions and anthropogenic activities (Ames et al., 2021).",
    "generation_length": 27,
    "movement_patterns": "Narwhals exhibit complex migratory patterns characterized by seasonal movements. During the summer, they inhabit offshore waters where they primarily feed, and they migrate towards coastal fjords in the winter (Higdon, 2009)(Ames et al., 2021). Strong site fidelity has been observed in specific populations, indicating that narwhals tend to return to traditional calving and feeding areas (Shuert et al., 2023). Changes in ice conditions due to climate change have recently been shown to influence their migratory behavior and feeding efficiency (Charry et al., 2018; .",
    "use_and_trade": "Narwhals are harvested by indigenous communities for subsistence and cultural practices; their tusks have historically been sought after for various purposes (Ames et al., 2021). Narwhal trade is regulated under CITES, which lists the species in Appendix II, managing international trade to prevent over-exploitation (Higdon, 2009). Local catches are monitored through NAMMCO catch data, which provides insights into sustainable management practices (Shuert et al., 2023).",
    "threats_overview": "Major threats to narwhals include climate change, which leads to the loss of sea ice habitat, making it harder for them to find food and reproduce (Charry et al., 2018; . Industrial activities such as shipping, fishing, and mineral extraction increase the risk of vessel strikes and habitat disruption (Ames et al., 2021). Additionally, hunting, although regulated, poses a risk, particularly to small populations; pollution and noise from shipping and oil exploration are also significant threats impacting their acoustic communication and overall health (Ames et al., 2021).",
    "conservation_overview": "Conservation efforts for narwhals include various international agreements and national policies. The Greenlandic government has implemented strict quotas for hunting, and joint agreements between Canada and Greenland aim to address conservation and management challenges (Charry et al., 2018; (Ames et al., 2021). Ongoing research and monitoring of population dynamics play a crucial role in guiding conservation strategies and protecting critical habitats from human impacts and climate change (Ames et al., 2021)."

      "subpopulations": "Recognized subpopulations of narwhals include those in Baffin Bay and Hudson Bay, among others. Each subpopulation exhibits specific ecological adaptations to local conditions; for instance, Baffin Bay narwhals demonstrate unique migratory patterns dependent on ice conditions and prey availability (Ames et al., 2021). Management units have been established to account for these ecological distinctions and ensure effective conservation strategies (Higdon, 2009)(Shuert et al., 2023).",
      "distribution_range": "Monodon monoceros is distributed widely across the Arctic, particularly in the Atlantic sector, including Canadian Arctic waters and Greenland (Higdon, 2009). The species is not typically found in the Pacific sector, making its range primarily circumpolar, with variations in adaptability among subpopulations due to differing climatic and environmental conditions (Ames et al., 2021).",
