    "description": "The Red-breasted Goose is a medium-sized goose with a distinctive plumage. It has a black head, neck, and upper breast, with a white cheek patch and a reddish-brown lower breast and belly (White et al., 2021; , Wada et al., 1995). The species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with males being slightly larger than females (Feenstra, 2002). Its unique anatomical features include webbed feet and a short, thick bill adapted for grazing (Vernon, 2011).",
    "habitat_description": "The Red-breasted Goose breeds in the Arctic tundra regions of northern Russia, primarily in the Yamal and Gydan Peninsulas (Sriyadi, 2023; , Hirano & Funase, 2019). During the breeding season, it prefers areas with low-growing vegetation, such as sedge meadows and dwarf shrub communities (Timmer et al., 2020; , Andel et al., 2023). In the non-breeding season, the species migrates to wintering grounds in the Black Sea region, where it utilizes a variety of habitats, including coastal wetlands, agricultural fields, and grasslands (Yoshioka et al., 2007; , Gentner & Claßen, 2006).",
    "population_size": "The global population of the Red-breasted Goose is estimated to be around 55,000-65,000 individuals, based on the most recent assessment conducted in 2015 (Benkert et al., 2008; , McRae et al., 1981).",
    "population_trend": "The Red-breasted Goose population has been declining over the past few decades, with a decrease of approximately 30-49% observed between 1991 and 2015 (Sun & Reed, 2010; , Yoshioka et al., 2009). The species is currently classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List (Adeyemo et al., 2024).",
    "generation_length": 10,
    "movement_patterns": "The Red-breasted Goose is a migratory species, with well-defined breeding and wintering grounds. It undertakes long-distance migrations between its breeding areas in the Russian Arctic and its wintering grounds in the Black Sea region (Sweeting et al., 2017; , Zhou et al., 2019). The species exhibits strong site fidelity, with individuals often returning to the same breeding and wintering sites year after year (Zhao & Wang, 2022; , Kehoe & Ruhl, 2013).",
    "use_and_trade": "The Red-breasted Goose is hunted for subsistence purposes by local communities in its breeding and wintering ranges,. The species is also subject to some commercial trade, primarily for its feathers and meat,. The Red-breasted Goose is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which prohibits international commercial trade,.",
    "threats_overview": "The primary threats to the Red-breasted Goose include habitat loss and degradation due to climate change, hunting, and disturbance from industrial activities (e.g., oil and gas exploration),. Additionally, the species is vulnerable to lead poisoning from spent ammunition and collisions with power lines and other infrastructure,.",
    "conservation_overview": "The Red-breasted Goose is protected under various national and international conservation agreements, including the African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement (AEWA) and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands,. Several protected areas have been established within the species' breeding and wintering ranges to safeguard its habitat,. Additionally, hunting quotas and regulations have been implemented in some countries to manage the sustainable use of the species,."
