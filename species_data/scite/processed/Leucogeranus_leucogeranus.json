    "description": "Antigone canadensis, commonly known as the Sandhill Crane, exhibits notable physical traits that include a height of approximately 90-120 cm and a wingspan of about 2 meters (Varner et al., 2019). The weight of these birds varies, with adult cranes typically weighing between 4.5 to 6.5 kg Fox et al., 2019). Coloration is predominantly a mix of grey and brown, featuring a distinctive red crown and white cheek patches, although there is little sexual dimorphism beyond size differences; males are generally larger than females, particularly in body mass (Krapu et al., 2014). Unique anatomical structures include long legs and a long neck, which aid in foraging and breeding Fox et al., 2019).",
    "habitat_description": "Sandhill Cranes prefer wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural fields for breeding and foraging. They are often found in shallow marshes and wet meadows where they can nest and raise young from late March through early July (Donnelly et al., 2024; . Seasonal variations are significant, as cranes migrate over long distances and depend heavily on available water sources and the timing of plant growth in their habitats (Varner et al., 2019). Their nesting sites require protective cover with access to water, which could become increasingly precarious with climate change (Donnelly et al., 2024; .",
    "population_size": "The most recent estimates suggest that the global population of Sandhill Cranes exceeds 600,000 individuals, based on data compiled from various regions across North America (Gates et al., 2013). Specifically, the Eastern Population of greater Sandhill Cranes is approximately 90,000 (Fronczak et al., 2017). These estimates reflect a recovery trend following conservation efforts across their range.",
    "population_trend": "Current trends indicate that the Sandhill Crane populations are stable to increasing in many areas due to extensive conservation measures and habitat restoration efforts, particularly for the Mid-continent Population Fox et al., 2019). However, significant concerns remain regarding localized populations affected by habitat loss and environmental changes (Fronczak et al., 2017).",
    "generation_length": 9,
    "movement_patterns": "Sandhill Cranes exhibit complex migratory patterns with a propensity for strong site fidelity, particularly when it comes to nesting territories Fox et al., 2019). They are known for long migrations; the Mid-continent Population migrates north from wintering grounds in the southern United States to breeding grounds in Canada and Alaska (Fronczak et al., 2017). Breeding site fidelity is high, with individuals often returning to the same location each year Fox et al., 2019).",
    "use_and_trade": "Sandhill Cranes have cultural significance in many Indigenous cultures and are also subject to regulated hunting in several U.S. states. The populations are managed under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which provides guidelines for sustainable harvest (Dinges et al., 2024). Harvest regulations reflect conservation concerns, and management is aimed at ensuring populations remain robust while allowing for controlled subsistence hunting.",
    "threats_overview": "Major threats to Sandhill Cranes include habitat loss due to agricultural expansion, climate change that alters wetland hydrology, and increased competition for shrinking water resources due to droughts or urbanization (Donnelly et al., 2024; (Fronczak et al., 2017)Fox et al., 2019). Hunting and disturbance from human activities, particularly in migratory stopover locations, also pose significant risks to their population stability (Dinges et al., 2024).",
    "conservation_overview": "National and international conservation efforts include the establishment of protected areas along migratory flyways, habitat restoration projects, and population monitoring programs (Conring et al., 2019; Fox et al., 2019). Specific programs have been developed in collaboration with various wildlife organizations and governmental bodies to coordinate conservation actions across state and national lines, ensuring that critical habitats are preserved for nesting and migration (Fronczak et al., 2017)."

      "subpopulations": "The Sandhill Crane has several recognized subspecies, including the Lesser Sandhill Crane (Antigone canadensis canadensis), Greater Sandhill Crane (Antigone canadensis tabida), and the Florida Sandhill Crane (Antigone canadensis pratensis) (Conring et al., 2019; . These subpopulations are geographically distinct, with varying ecological pressures and conservation needs, particularly the Florida population, which has specific habitat requirements tied to marshes and wetlands in that region (Dinges et al., 2024).",
      "distribution_range": "Sandhill Cranes have a broad distribution throughout North America, with significant populations across Canada, the United States, and parts of Mexico. In the Arctic context, these birds primarily inhabit the tundra regions during breeding seasons, with specific migratory pathways crossing from their wintering areas in Texas and New Mexico toward northern latitudes (Luz‐Ricca et al., 2022).",
