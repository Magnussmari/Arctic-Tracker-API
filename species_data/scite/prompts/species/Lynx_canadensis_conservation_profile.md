I am compiling a comprehensive conservation profile for the Arctic species **Lynx canadensis** (Canada Lynx). Please help populate the following fields with concise, referenced information. Cite peer-reviewed scientific literature wherever possible.

1. Description
Provide a summary of the species' key biological and physical traits: average size, weight, coloration, sexually dimorphic features, and any unique anatomical structures (e.g., tusks, plumage, baleen, etc.).

2. Habitat Description
Describe its preferred habitat(s), including seasonal variations, climate dependencies, depth range (if aquatic), and known migratory or breeding areas.

3. Population Size
What is the most recent and widely accepted estimate of global population size? Include the publication year and data source.

4. Population Trend
State the current trend (e.g., increasing, stable, decreasing) and provide data from recent population assessments, ideally with regional notes if relevant.

5. Generation Length
Provide the best-estimate of the species' generation length (in years) as reported in ecological or conservation literature.

6. Movement Patterns
Outline known migratory patterns, seasonal dispersal behavior, and any strong site fidelity or philopatry traits.

7. Subpopulations
List recognized subpopulations or management units, including geographic separation and ecological distinctions.

8. Distribution Range
Describe the overall geographic distribution, especially in the Arctic context (e.g., Atlantic vs Pacific sector, circumpolar, endemic range, etc.).

9. Threats Overview
Summarize major threats: climate change, habitat loss, hunting, pollution, bycatch, industrial activity, entrapment risks, or disease. Prioritize severity and citation.

10. Use and Trade
Detail how this species is used by humans (e.g., subsistence, commercial trade, cultural uses, ivory or pelts). Mention regulation and CITES status if applicable.

11. Conservation Overview
List national/international conservation actions in place, including quotas, habitat protections, species management plans, or joint agreements (e.g., Canada-Greenland commissions).

## Additional Research Context

**Terrestrial Mammal Specific Considerations:**
- Include prey-predator relationships and ecosystem role
- Note den site requirements and territorial behavior
- Consider human-wildlife conflict issues
- Include traditional knowledge and cultural significance
- Reference circumpolar management agreements
