Conservation Profile for Alopias vulpinus (Common Thresher Shark)
Description
The Common Thresher Shark (Alopias vulpinus) is a large pelagic species, typically reaching an average length of 3 to 4 meters, with some individuals reported to grow up to 6 meters (Gervelis & Natanson, 2013). They can weigh between 200 to 300 kg (Gervelis & Natanson, 2013). The species is characterized by a long, slender body and a distinctive, elongated upper lobe of the caudal fin that can account for nearly half of its total body length. Their coloration is generally grey or brown with a lighter underside, aiding in countershading (Gervelis & Natanson, 2013)Wootton et al., 2015). There are known sexually dimorphic features: females tend to be larger than males at maturity, with size at maturity estimated at 215.8 cm fork length for females and 188.4 cm for males (Gervelis & Natanson, 2013). Unique anatomical structures such as the tail have been noted to play a significant role in their hunting strategies, where tail-slapping behavior is used to stun prey (Oliver et al., 2013).

Habitat Description
Common Thresher Sharks are predominantly found in offshore oceanic waters, favoring the epipelagic zone at depths of up to 150 m, although they can dive deeper (Cartamil et al., 2010; . They exhibit a preference for temperatures ranging between 18°C and 24°C, which influences their seasonal distributions (Cartamil et al., 2010; . Habitats include continental shelves and oceanic ridges, with seasonal migrations observed toward warmer waters during winter and northern movements toward cooler waters during other seasons (Coelho et al., 2015; (Cartamil et al., 2010; .

Population Size
The population size of Common Thresher Sharks is currently not well quantified, but recent assessments show that global populations are likely declining. The specific numbers are difficult to ascertain owing to their migratory nature and sparse data availability (Gervelis & Natanson, 2013).

Population Trend
The overall trend for Alopias vulpinus is currently decreasing. Recent assessments have indicated that the population has been significantly impacted due to overfishing, especially in the North Atlantic and North Pacific regions, leading to concerns regarding their sustainability (Cartamil et al., 2011; (Oliver et al., 2019).

Generation Length
Conservative estimates place the generation length of the Common Thresher Shark at approximately 12 years (Gervelis & Natanson, 2013). This figure reflects the time taken for individuals to reach reproductive maturity and contribute to the population.

Movement Patterns
Common Thresher Sharks exhibit strong migratory behaviors, moving between feeding and breeding grounds based on seasonal changes (Cartamil et al., 2010; Cartamil et al., 2010). They are known to undertake extensive transjurisdictional movements, complicating conservation efforts. High levels of site fidelity have also been reported in certain regions, making them vulnerable to localized fishing pressures (Cartamil et al., 2011; (Oliver et al., 2019).

Subpopulations
Distinct subpopulations of Alopias vulpinus may occur in different ocean basins such as the North Atlantic and North Pacific. However, there is a lack of concrete genetic studies identifying clear subpopulations within these contexts (Morales et al., 2018).

Distribution Range
Geographically, the Common Thresher Shark is distributed globally in temperate and tropical waters. In Arctic waters, their presence is primarily noted in the North Atlantic, though they are not considered endemic to this region (Coelho et al., 2015; (Gervelis & Natanson, 2013).

Threats Overview
Major threats to the Common Thresher Shark include overfishing, bycatch from tuna and swordfish fisheries, habitat degradation, and climate change which alters their migratory patterns and habitat (Lee et al., 2024)(Oliver et al., 2019). Pollutants such as PFAS have been detected within their populations, indicating potential health risks associated with declining environmental conditions (Lee et al., 2024).

Use and Trade
The Common Thresher Shark is commercially valued primarily for its meat and fins, contributing to its exposure to overfishing pressures (Gervelis & Natanson, 2013). They are included in the CITES Appendix II, highlighting the need for regulated trade to prevent overexploitation (KANEDI et al., 2023).

Conservation Overview
Current conservation measures include regional fishing quotas, specific management plans addressing bycatch, and habitat protection initiatives. International cooperation is vital for their conservation, necessitating agreements like the Canada-Greenland Commissions to provide cross-border protections (Oliver et al., 2019).
