# CMS Migration Summary

## Current Situation (August 8, 2025)

The CMS data integration was documented as "complete" on July 10, 2025, but investigation reveals:
- ❌ The `cms_listings` table is empty (0 records)
- ❌ The table schema in production doesn't match the expected schema
- ❌ The `species_cms_listings` view doesn't exist
- ❌ All `cms_status_current` fields in `article_summary_table` are NULL

## Root Cause

The migration SQL was never executed in the production database, and the data loading script was never run without the `--dry-run` flag.

## Solution Overview

This folder contains everything needed to properly complete the CMS migration:

1. **SQL Scripts** to create tables with correct schema
2. **Python Scripts** to load the 31 species CMS data
3. **Verification Scripts** to ensure data integrity
4. **Update Queries** to populate the article_summary_table

## Key Files

- **Start Here**: `CMS_MIGRATION_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`
- **Quick Reference**: `MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md`
- **SQL Queries**: `cms_migration_queries.sql`
- **Table Creation**: `create_cms_listings_table.sql`
- **Data Loading**: `load_cms_data_to_db.py`

## Expected Results

After completing the migration:
- 31 Arctic species will have CMS conservation status
- The article_summary_table will show cms_status_current values
- Iconic species like Polar Bear and Narwhal will show Appendix II status
- The Arctic Tracker will have complete international conservation data (CITES + CMS)

## Time Required

Approximately 30-45 minutes to complete all steps, including verification.
