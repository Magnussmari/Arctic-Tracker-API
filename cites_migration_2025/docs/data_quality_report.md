  - 41 CITES trade records extracted (1981-2018)
  - Total quantity: 238 specimens
  - The taxonomy difference (hutchinsii vs canadensis) reflects recent taxonomic revisions

## Temporal Analysis

- **Earliest Record**: 1975 (multiple species)
- **Latest Record**: 2024 (multiple species)
- **Peak Trading Years**: 2010-2020 (based on preliminary analysis)

## Data Quality Indicators

### ‚úÖ Positive Findings
1. Complete temporal coverage (50 years)
2. All major Arctic species represented
3. Consistent data structure across all records
4. No data corruption detected
5. Successful parallel processing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas of Concern
1. Extremely high quantity values for some species (needs validation)
2. Taxonomy differences need to be accounted for in extraction (Branta hutchinsii vs canadensis)
3. Some species have very few records (statistical significance?)

## Current vs. New Data Comparison

### Current Database (as of July 2025)
- **Total CITES records**: 461,042

## Migration Readiness Assessment

### ‚úÖ Ready for Migration
- Data extracted successfully
- Format compatible with current schema
- All required fields present
- Species IDs mapped correctly

### üìã Pre-Migration Tasks
1. Validate extreme quantity values
2. ‚úÖ Re-run extraction completed - Branta canadensis leucopareia records included
3. Review 2024 records for completeness
4. Create backup of current data
5. Test import with subset

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - ‚úÖ Extraction re-run completed with all 43 species
   - Create comprehensive backup of current cites_trade_records
   - Validate quantity values for marine species

2. **Migration Strategy**
   - Use staging table approach
   - Migrate in batches by year
   - Validate each batch before proceeding
   - Keep audit trail of changes

3. **Post-Migration**
   - Update species_trade_summary table
   - Regenerate all statistics
   - Verify data integrity
   - Update documentation

## Next Steps

1. Review this report with stakeholders
2. Create detailed migration plan
3. Set up staging environment
4. Begin test migration with 2024 data
5. Full migration upon successful testing
