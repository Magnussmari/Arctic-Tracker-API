File Summary

|- data
| |- 01_taxa_use_combos.csv: Table with taxa seized along with the reported used-type. Each row corresponds to a unique taxa/use-type combination.
| |- 02_gbif_taxonomic_key.csv: Table with taxonomic information for each seized taxa. Taxonomic information gathered from GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility). 
| |- 03_gbif_common_names.csv: Table with common names of seized taxa. Common names gathered from GBIF.
| |- 03_gbif_common_names.rds: The same table as 03_gbif_common_names.csv except saved as an R data file (.rds), which preserves the proper encoding of common names in other languages. Preference to use this file over 03_gbif_common_names.csv when working with common names in other languages.
| |- 04_db_generic_common_names.csv. Table with common names and generic names gathered from: (i) TRAFFIC International Wildlife Trade Portal and (ii) LEMIS (Law Enforcement Management Information System from the United States Fish and Wildlife Services).
| |- 05_use_search_words.csv: Table with 'Internet friendly' search words for each use-type. 
| - scripts
| |- example_search_phrases.R: A script to generate search phrases of wildlife species seized in the illegal wildlife trade. Three examples include: (i) get all common names of seized wildlife from the GBIF database, (ii) get taxa and use-type combinations with the species and common names associated with them, and (iii) a more specific example of the species and common names of all bird species recorded as being seized as feathers.
| sessionInfo.txt: description of computer specifications, R version, and R package versions used for example_search_phrases.R
| dataset_of_seized_wildlife_and_their_intended_uses.Rproj: R project file that allows one to open this directory as an R project in RStudio

Field/Column Descriptions (columns names denoted by backticks ``)

1. 01_taxa_use_combos.csv
- `db`: the database where the record is derived from. "wtp" represents TRAFFIC International Wildlife Trade Portal, "lemis" represents LEMIS (Law Enforcement Management Information System from the United States Fish and Wildlife Services), and "cites" represents CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) trade database
- `db_original_usetype`: the original name of the use-type specified by the database (TRAFFIC, LEMIS, CITES)
- `standardized_use_type`: a standardized name for the use-types described in `db_original_usetype`
- `standardized_use_id`: a unique identifier for the standardized use-types in `standardized_use_type`. This column can be joined to the 05_use_search_words.csv data table to obtain search words for each use type.  
- `subcategory`: the subcategory to which the `standardized_use_type` belongs in
- `main_category`: the main category to which the `standardized_use_type` belongs in
- `db_taxa_name`: the taxonomic name specified by the database (TRAFFIC, LEMIS, CITES)
- `db_taxa_name_clean`: `db_taxa_name` but cleaned to remove extraneous parts of the taxonomic name such as: "species", "spp.", "family". 
- `gbif_id`: a unique identifier given to identify the taxa. This identifier was generated by GBIF. Use this identifier to join in taxonomic information provided in the 02_gbif_taxonomic_key.csv data table and common names provided in the 03_gbif_common_names.csv data table. 
 
2. 02_gbif_taxonomic_key.csv
- `db`: the database where the record is derived from. "wtp" represents TRAFFIC International Wildlife Trade Portal, "lemis" represents LEMIS (Law Enforcement Management Information System from the United States Fish and Wildlife Services), and "cites" represents CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) trade database
- `db_taxa_name`: the taxonomic name specified by the database (TRAFFIC, LEMIS, CITES)
- `db_taxa_name_clean`: `db_taxa_name` but cleaned to remove extraneous parts of the taxonomic name such as: "species", "spp.", "family". 
- `match_type`: the match result from automated searches through GBIF. We used the ‘get_gbif_id’ function in the R package taxize (v. 0.9.95.91) to resolve taxonomy. There are six different match types, as follows: (i) “exact & accepted” means the taxa was an exact match and taxonomy was accepted by GBIF (i.e., not a synonym), (ii) “higher rank & accepted” means the match was of a rank higher than species (e.g., genus) and taxonomy was accepted by GBIF, (iii) “synonyms with correct key” means the match was of a synonym name but GBIF provided the correct unique identifier linked to the accepted taxa, (iv) “synonyms with incorrect key” means the match was of a synonym, however more than one result was returned each with a different accepted key, and these matches were later manually matched to GBIF, (v) “manually matched” means that there were no results returned and we manually matched the taxa to GBIF, and (vi) “custom_hybrid” means the taxa was a hybrid (which GBIF does not include in it’s taxonomy) and we created a custom identifier for these taxa.
- `gbif_id`: a unique identifier given to identify the taxa. This identifier was generated by GBIF. Use this identifier to join in taxa-use combinations provided in the 01_taxa_use_combos.csv data table and common names provided in the 03_gbif_common_names.csv data table.

4. 04_db_generic_common_names.csv
- `db`: the database where the record is derived from. "wtp" represents TRAFFIC International Wildlife Trade Portal, "lemis" represents LEMIS (Law Enforcement Management Information System from the United States Fish and Wildlife Services), and "cites" represents CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) trade database

- `db_name`: the common or generic name provided by the database
- `db_name_type`: whether `db_name` is a common or generic name. Note only LEMIS provided generic names, TRAFFIC provided common names only, and CITES did not provide generic nor common names. 

5. 05_use_search_words.csv
- `standardized_use_id`: a unique identifier for the standardized use-types in `standardized_use_type`. This column can be joined to the 05_use_search_words.csv data table to obtain search words for each use type.  
- `standardized_use_type`: a standardized name for the use-types described in 01_taxa_use_combos.csv.
- `search_word`: the ‘Internet friendly’ search word associated with a use type.
