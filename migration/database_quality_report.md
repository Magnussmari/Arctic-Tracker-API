# Arctic Tracker Database Quality Report
## Trade Data Pipeline Analysis - July 28, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

The Arctic Tracker trade data pipeline successfully processes 43 Arctic species, extracting CITES trade data, conservation status, and trade analytics. However, several critical database issues were identified that require immediate attention to ensure complete and accurate data extraction.

## üî¥ Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Fix

### 1. **species_trade_summary Table is Empty**
- **Impact**: All species show 0 records and 0 quantity in the summary fields
- **Cause**: The pre-computed summary table has no data
- **Solution**: Run the aggregation script to populate this table with trade statistics
- **Workaround**: Pipeline currently falls back to direct queries, but this is inefficient

### 2. **CITES Listings Table Column Error**
- **Error**: `column cites_listings.effective_date does not exist`
- **Impact**: Cannot retrieve CITES appendix listings or track status changes
- **Actual Column**: The correct column is `listing_date` (confirmed)
- **Affects**: All 43 species - no CITES status data retrieved
- **Quick Fix**: Update pipeline to use `listing_date` instead of `effective_date`

### 3. **Missing Species in Database**
The following species are not found in the species table:
- **Aleutian cackling goose** (Branta hutchinsii leucopareia)
- **Dall's Porpoise** (Phocoenoides dalli)
- **Harbour Porpoise** (Phocoena phocoena)
- **North Pacific Right Whale** (Eubalaena japonica)
- **Roseroot** (Rhodiola rosea) - Note: This is a plant species

## üü° Data Quality Issues

### 1. **Incomplete IUCN Assessment Data**
- Many species lack IUCN status information
- No historical assessments to track status changes
- Missing assessment dates for trend analysis

### 2. **Trade Data Completeness**
Despite having trade records, the summary shows:
- **Record Counts**: All showing as 0 in summary
- **Quantities**: All showing as 0 in summary
- **But**: Detailed analysis shows actual trade data exists (purposes, sources, quantities)

### 3. **CMS Status Not Implemented**
- CMS (Convention on Migratory Species) status fields remain empty
- No CMS data tables identified in the database
- Required for complete conservation status reporting

## üìä Data Extraction Success Metrics

### Successfully Extracted:
- ‚úÖ **38/43 species** found and processed (88% success rate)
- ‚úÖ **Trade purposes** analyzed (e.g., Commercial 93.9% for Siberian Sturgeon)
- ‚úÖ **Source analysis** working (Wild vs. Pre-convention specimens)
- ‚úÖ **Trade trends** calculated (increasing/decreasing/stable)
- ‚úÖ **Export analysis** complete with percentages
- ‚úÖ **Latest trade quantities** extracted

### Failed Extractions:
- ‚ùå CITES appendix listings (100% failure due to column error)
- ‚ùå CITES status change tracking
- ‚ùå Trade suspension data for Arctic states
- ‚ùå CMS status and changes

## üîß Recommended Database Fixes

### Priority 1 - Immediate Fixes
1. **Populate species_trade_summary table**
   ```sql
   -- Run aggregation to populate summary table
   INSERT INTO species_trade_summary (species_id, total_records, total_quantity, min_year, max_year)
   SELECT species_id, COUNT(*), SUM(quantity), MIN(year), MAX(year)
   FROM cites_trade_records
   GROUP BY species_id;
   ```

2. **Fix CITES listings table query**
   ```sql
   -- First, identify correct column name
   SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'cites_listings';
   ```

3. **Add missing species**
   - Import missing species with correct scientific names
   - Ensure common name variations are included

### Priority 2 - Data Completeness
1. **Import IUCN historical assessments**
2. **Add CMS status data and tables**
3. **Import CITES trade suspension data**

### Priority 3 - Performance Optimization
1. **Create indexes on frequently queried columns**:
   - `species_id` in all tables
   - `year` in trade records
   - `exporter` in trade records

2. **Create materialized views for complex aggregations**

## üìà Performance Observations

- **Processing Time**: ~23 seconds for 43 species
- **API Calls**: ~20 queries per species (inefficient)
- **Recommendation**: Batch queries and use JOIN operations where possible

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working Well

1. **Species name normalization** - Successfully handling variations
2. **Trade trend analysis** - Accurate calculations based on available data
3. **Export country analysis** - Correctly identifying top exporters with percentages
4. **Error handling** - Graceful fallbacks when data is missing
5. **Purpose analysis** - Accurately categorizing trade purposes

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix CITES listings column reference
2. **This Week**: Populate species_trade_summary table
3. **This Month**: Import missing species and complete IUCN/CMS data
4. **Long Term**: Optimize query performance with better indexing

## Conclusion

The Arctic Tracker database contains valuable trade data but requires several fixes to achieve full functionality. The most critical issues are the empty summary table and incorrect column references. Once these are resolved, the pipeline will provide comprehensive trade analytics for Arctic species conservation efforts.
